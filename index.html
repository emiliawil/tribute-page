        <h2 class="subheading">Life and achievements</h2>
        <p>Tove Jansson, in full Tove Marika Jansson, was a Finnish artist and writer-illustrator of children’s books (in Swedish). In her books she created the fantastic self-contained world of Moomintrolls, popular especially in northern and central Europe, although translations in more than 30 languages have provided a worldwide audience.</p>
        <p>Jansson was the daughter of artists, and her illustrations began appearing in children’s magazines when she was a teenager. She studied painting in Stockholm, had her first exhibition in 1943, and worked for a time as a children’s book illustrator. In Småtrollen och den stora översvämningen (1945; “The Moomins and the Great Flood”) she introduced her hippopotamus-like creatures. The work was praised for its individualistic characters, complicated plots, and sophisticated humour, and eight other Moomin books followed. Jansson also created the comic strip “Moomin,” which ran in the Evening News in London from 1953 to 1960. She won the Stockholm Award for best children’s books in 1952, the Selma Lagerlöf Medal in 1953, the International Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1966, and many other honours. Jansson also wrote an autobiography, Bild-huggarens dotter (1968; Sculptor’s Daughter), short stories, plays, and adult fiction.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Moomintroll</h2>
        <p>Moomintroll, 20th-century Finnish literary and comic-strip character, a white, furry creature somewhat resembling a hippopotamus.</p>
        <p>The Moomins, creations of the Finnish writer-illustrator Tove Jansson, were a family of mythical creatures whose home was in a wooded place known as Moominvalley. The protagonist of most stories was the young Moomintroll, a happy and friendly, though somewhat naive, troll who was drawn to adventure. Also often depicted were his parents, the morally upstanding Moominmamma and the responsible but restless Moominpappa. Moomintroll’s best friend was Snufkin, a human wanderer; he also was close to his adopted brother, a brown, ratlike creature named Sniff. Some stories featured Moomintroll’s love interest, the Snork Maiden, who resembled the Moomins in appearance.
        <p>
        <p>Jansson was working as a commercial artist in the 1940s when she began incorporating a small, troll-like character into her signature on magazine illustrations. The character eventually became Moomintroll, who made his public debut in the children’s novel Småtrollen och den stora översvämningen (1945; “The Moomins and the Great Flood”). The many Moominland novels and picture books that followed were also written and initially published in Swedish. For atmosphere Jansson drew on her own childhood summers in the Stockholm archipelago; she prominently featured the sea, expressed a love of nature, and championed open-mindedness.</p>
        <p>After the series’ conclusion in 1970, the Moomins continued to appear in other media, including a newspaper comic strip that ran through 1974, several animated television series in Finland, Poland, and Japan, and even an opera. The 1990s saw a resurgence in popularity for the Moomins, leading to new animated television episodes and a Finnish theme park called Muumimaailma (Moomin World).</p>
